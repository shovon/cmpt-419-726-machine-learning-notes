Hi,

Welcome to the beginnings of Tufte LaTeX package to help you
produce Tufte-style handouts, reports, and notes.

## Quick Start

Try typesetting `ml.tex` with the following command,

    pdflatex ml

The result should look like `ml.pdf`.

### Integrating Into Atom

Install the Atom [build package](https://atom.io/packages/build) and add the following configuration to a `.atom-build.json` at the root of the project.

```json
{
  "cmd": "pdflatex",
  "name": "Latex",
  "args": [ "-halt-on-error", "ml" ],
  "sh": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors of the form,

    ! LaTeX Error: File `paralist.sty' not found.

you will need to obtain missing packages from [CTAN](http://ctan.org).
For package installation instructions and answers to many other
questions, see the [UK TeX FAQ](http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?introduction=yes) or search the [`comp.text.tex` group](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex).

The following packages are required:

 * chngpage or changepage
 * fancyhdr
 * fontenc
 * geometry
 * hyperref
 * natbib and bibentry
 * optparams
 * paralist
 * placeins
 * ragged2e
 * setspace
 * textcase
 * textcomp
 * titlesec
 * titletoc
 * xcolor
 * xifthen

The following packages are optional and will be automatically used if installed:

 * beramono
 * helvet
 * ifpdf
 * ifxetex
 * letterspace (in the microtype package)
 * mathpazo
 * soul
